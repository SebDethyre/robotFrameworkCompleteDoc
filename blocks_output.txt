Grep File

  - path
  - pattern
  - encoding=UTF-8
  - encoding_errors=strict
  - regexp=False

Returns the lines of the specified file that match the `pattern`.

This keyword reads a file from the file system using the defined `path`,
`encoding` and `encoding_errors` similarly as Get File. A difference is that
only the lines that match the given `pattern` are returned. Lines are returned
as a single string concatenated back together with newlines and the number of
matched lines is automatically logged. Possible trailing newline is never
returned.

A line matches if it contains the `pattern` anywhere in it i.e. it does not
need to match the pattern fully. There are two supported pattern types:

  * By default the pattern is considered a _glob_ pattern where, for example, `*` and `?` can be used as wildcards.
  * If the `regexp` argument is given a true value, the pattern is considered to be a _regular expression_. These patterns are more powerful but also more complicated than glob patterns. They often use the backslash character and it needs to be escaped in Robot Framework date like \\\.

For more information about glob and regular expression syntax, see the Pattern
matching section. With this keyword matching is always case-sensitive.

Examples:

${errors} =  Grep File  /var/log/myapp.log  ERROR    
---------------  
${ret} =  Grep File  ${CURDIR}/file.txt  [Ww]ildc??d ex*ple    
${ret} =  Grep File  ${CURDIR}/file.txt  [Ww]ildc\\\w+d ex.*ple  regexp=True  
  
Special encoding values `SYSTEM` and `CONSOLE` that Get File supports are
supported by this keyword only with Robot Framework 4.0 and newer.

Support for regular expressions is new in Robot Framework 5.0.
